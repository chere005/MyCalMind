/**
 * A wide, obtuse chevron — the text glyphs (▾ ⌄ ▸ ›) render cramped and narrow;
 * this one is drawn, with round caps, pointing down when open and right when
 * folded: the collapse language the suite's chevrons speak.
 *
 * ONE size for every collapse in the app, exported so no screen can pick its
 * own. There were three treatments before — a drawn chevron at 15 for folders
 * and 14 for sections in Reminders and Notes, a 12pt '▸/▾' in the calendar's
 * day panel, and a 14pt '›/⌄' in Habits — which is what Sean saw as the same
 * control drawn differently on every page. It landed at 13, then 11, and Sean
 * asked for 60% of that: 7.
 *
 * The STROKE scales with it. It was pinned at 2, which is 18% of 11 but 29%
 * of 7 — shrinking the box alone would have left a stubbier, heavier glyph
 * rather than the same one smaller, which is not what "60% of its current
 * size" means. CHEVRON_STROKE keeps the ratio the drawn chevron has always
 * had.
 *
 * Size is DECORATION here, never the tap target: the wrappers own that (see
 * chevWrap, which carries an explicit height for exactly this reason).
 * hitSlop is a no-op under react-native-web, so on the web a control is only
 * as big as it is drawn — shrink the glyph without fixing the box and the
 * target shrinks with it.
 *
 * Not to be confused with the '›' at the end of a note row: that one means
 * "open this", not "collapse this", and is deliberately left alone.
