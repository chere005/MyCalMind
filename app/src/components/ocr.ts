 * OCR for the recipe importer.

 * already on the device, no download, on the neural engine, and markedly
 * better at what this app actually does — a photograph of a printed card,
 * taken at an angle, in a kitchen.
 *
 * Android has no path yet and says so. The message names the platform rather
 * than claiming 'not supported', because 'open it in a browser' is a real
 * answer there and a dead end is not.
