                      This was the last cycler in the app. The 2026-08-18
                      migration gave every manager a SwatchTray — pick the
                      colour you want, see them all at once — and this dot
                      kept the old behaviour it replaced: one palette step per
                      tap, on an eleven-pixel target with ten more of slop, so
                      the commonest way to reach it was by accident while

                            Reserving their slots was the first fix and it did
                            stop the row moving, at the cost of a permanently
                            narrower name. This is the Reminders pattern
                            instead, which its own comment already argued for:
                            an absolutely positioned cluster over an opaque
                            background, so nothing reflows and the text it
                            covers is simply not shown.

                            OPAQUE MEANS OPAQUE — Sean, 2026-08-12, asked for
                            these "more opaque". The background was the name
                            box's own `tint(color, '14')`, and that is 8% alpha:
                            the habit's name read straight through the icons
                            sitting on top of it, so the one thing the pattern
                            promised was the one thing it was not doing. It is
                            T.bg with the same wash laid over it now, which is
                            exactly what the name box is made of — same colour
                            to the eye, and nothing behind it shows. */}

  /**
   * The floating edit controls.
   *
   * They sit ON TOP of the habit's own name box rather than beside it, so the
   * name keeps its full width whether or not edit mode is open and nothing in
   * the row moves as it opens.
   *
   * The first fix reserved slots for these instead. It held the row still —
   * which was the ask — but shrank every habit name permanently to do it, and
   * Sean said so: "the sizes shouldn't have shrunk".
   *
   * THE BACKGROUND IS TWO LAYERS, and that is the whole point of it: T.bg,
   * which is opaque and is what the page is made of, with the name box's own
   * `tint(color, '14')` laid over the top. The second layer is what makes the
   * cluster read as part of the box rather than as a hole punched in it; the
   * first is what actually hides the name underneath. It was the wash ALONE
   * before — 8% alpha, so the text showed straight through the icons and Sean
   * asked for them "more opaque" (2026-08-12). One layer could not do both
   * jobs, so there are two, and the pair composites to exactly the colour the
   * name box already is.
   *
   * The wash is a filled child rather than a second backgroundColor because a
   * View has only one; it is not clipped with `overflow: 'hidden'` because
   * that would also clip the WebHitSlop expanders inside, which are the only
   * thing giving these controls a real tap target on the web at all.
