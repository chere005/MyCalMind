/**
 WHY THE CALENDAR COLOUR OFTEN IS NOT THE COLOUR YOU SEE.

 Sean, 2026-08-11: "i don't see colors for dates/times on the watch
 complication". Nothing was broken — watchOS was discarding the colour.

 A complication on a watch face is not drawn in full colour. WidgetKit hands
 the view a `widgetRenderingMode`, and on the face it is one of:

   .accented  the system splits the view into TWO groups and tints each with
              a colour the FACE chooses — one for anything marked
              `widgetAccentable(true)`, one for everything else. Your colours
              are replaced, not blended;
   .vibrant   everything is flattened to a monochrome, desaturated wash of
              the face's material. Colour is gone entirely.

 `.fullColor` — where `Color(hex:)` means what it says — is what the previews,
 the gallery and the iPhone's Smart Stack use, not the wrist.

 WHICH FACE MATTERS, and it is the answer to "why is my complication grey".
 Confirmed on Sean's own watch, 2026-08-11: the MODULAR face overrides the
 colours, and moving the complication to a face that renders them — Infograph
 Modular has the same three-row layout — brought them back. So if the times
 are monochrome, the face is the thing to change, not this file.

 So the colour is kept for the case where it can be honoured, and where it
 cannot, the TIME is put in the accent group instead: on an `.accented` face
 it then takes the face's accent colour while the event's name stays in the
 default one, which is the only "different colour for the time" the platform
 actually offers. Under `.vibrant` nothing can be done with colour, so weight
 does the work instead.
