/**
 The wrist's reminders, in the phone's own structure: folder, then section,
 then the rows — Sean asked for the grouping rather than one flat list.

 A 41mm screen is about 25 characters wide, so the structure has to earn its
 space. Three decisions, stated rather than assumed:

 - A folder header is drawn ONLY when there is more than one folder. With a
   single folder its name is a title bar for the whole page and says nothing.
 - A section header is drawn only when its folder has more than one section.
   A folder with one section has already been named by the folder.
 - Every name is one line, truncated at the tail. Nothing wraps: two lines of
   header above a one-line reminder inverts what the page is for. The phone's
   nesting is at most folder → section, so there is no deeper case to handle.

 Order is the phone's order throughout — the feed arrives sorted and nothing
 here re-sorts it.

    /// empty. His watch is in exactly that state right now, so the first
