/**
 How the wrist says a time and a day. ONE implementation, so nothing is left
 speaking 24-hour after Sean asked for 12 — the complication, the events
 list, the month page and the reminder rows all come through here.

 His spec came in two passes. First: `Today 3pm event name` or
 `8/15 5pm event name` — 12-hour, lowercase, no leading zero on the hour, no
 ':00' on the hour, no separator glyph between the parts.

 Then he tightened it for the face: drop am/pm unless the time is 8pm or
 later, and on the COMPLICATION drop "Today" entirely and show only the time.
 So a line now reads `Today 3 event name`, `8/15 5 event name`, `8pm dinner`,
 and the complication reads `3` for that first one.

 Cases he did not name, decided here and stated plainly:
   - half past reads "3:30" — minutes appear only when there are any
   - an ALL-DAY event has no time to show, so it reads "Today Chase" or
     "8/15 Chase" rather than inventing a midnight; on the complication,
     where the day is otherwise dropped, an all-day event today keeps the
     word "Today" because there is nothing else to say
   - no time ever reads "am". The only times that carry a suffix are 20:00
     and later, and they are all pm
