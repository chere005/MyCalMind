 The iPhone home-screen widget, drawn to match the Scriptable widget Sean had
 actually been living with — `tools/scriptable-widget.js`, REMOVED ENTIRELY on
 2026-08-12 on his word, so this native one is now the only home-screen
 widget and the references to it below are lineage rather than a file you can
 open. That widget's decisions are kept deliberately: near-black card, one heading per DAY rather than per kind, a
 square tick box for a reminder (a thing to DO) against a coloured dot for an
 event, the label one line, the time right-aligned in grey, a hairline under
 each date and a heavier rule between days.

 It is its own process, so it reads the App Group cache WatchBridge writes on
 every store change — the same feed the watch and the complication read.
